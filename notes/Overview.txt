**Overview**

Systems Utilized : 

--DT_Script_Library : Provides scripts for general applications

View : 
The view is adjusted to match the dimenions of the devices screen size, and then is scaled
scaled to match. 

Dimensions are a height of 1000px with a variable width, depending on the device. The app is 
strictly vertically oriented. 

Objects : 

The entire app is broken down into an MVC model, as such...

CONTROLLER
con_master_controller - manages the interaction between the view objects and the controller
con_forms - this handles all the input by the user
con_push_notifications - handles the push notifications
scr_view_scale - this script scales the view for the app

VIEW
vw_pendulum - The pendulum object that sways in the background
vw_button - a button, that when pressed calls a script
vw_button_icon - same as a regular buttonm, but works off of an image instead
vw_drawer - A drawer, that contains buttons or text that can be taken out or put away in use
vw_day_counter - the counter the user sees on the main screen
vw_timer - the timer used in the meditation portion of the app

MODEL
global.quote_database = a database containing the library of quotes
global.death_day = a date object containing the death day for the user
*************ALL THATS GOING BY BY

The quote of the day is the only thing the app will need, and it will be retreived from the
bymorte quotes api. 

Systems : 

The following systems are required...

Sprite, Box, and Font Scaling
- A set of "wrapper" scripts that draw sprites, boxes, and fonts based on the width of the screen

System for loading and unloading the saves to a global array
