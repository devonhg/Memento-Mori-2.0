###Buttons

	Buttons are created using one of two scripts.

		scr_add_button( X, Y, Text, Width, Height, Box Color, Border Color, Text_Color, Border Width, Call Script, Layer, Height Adjust, *Parent )
		Calling this script specifies a button and what script to call when the button is clicked/pressed. Optionally assign a parent
		object and the button will lock its x/y positions realtive to the parent object.

		scr_add_sprite_button( X, Y, Sprite, Call Script, Layer, *Parent)
		Exactly the same as the other script, except you use a sprite instead of a generated button.
		
###Drawers

	Drawers are used to add buttons and other elements in spaces outside of the screen that can be brought in when needed.
	
	Assigning a button to a drawer
	
		Simply set the "parent" argument of a button to the id of the drawer. The X/Y value will be the adjustment values. 
		
	Assigning an object to a drawer
	
		Call the script "scr_child_to_parent" in the end step event of an object and specify the id of the drawer, which can be
		found using the scr_btn_find_drawer script.
