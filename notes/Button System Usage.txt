	###Death Date
	
		The death date is what runs the entire app, and is what's stored locally on the phone. There are a few scripts available
		to manipulate the death date. 
		
			scr_calculate_days_left - Returns the exact number of days until the coming death day. 
		
			*scr_md_set_dd - Give this script a date to update the death day to, it updates the database(ini) to the set death day. Leave
			empty to return the current death day. 
			
	###Quote Of The Day
	
		Every day the app generates a new quote of the day from it's local database if no connection is found, otherwise pulls
		from the database on Knack. 
			
			*scr_add_qod - Add a quote of the day to the local database. 
			
			*scr_reset_qod - Reset the quote of the day to a new quote.
			
			*scr_get_qod - Get the current quote of the day, if offline it pulls a quote from the local database. If online it 
			takes the online qod from knack and adds it to the local database and expands it.

	###Buttons

		Buttons are created using one of two scripts.

			scr_add_button( X, Y, Text, Width, Height, Box Color, Border Color, Text_Color, Border Width, Call Script, Layer, Height Adjust, *Parent )
			Calling this script specifies a button and what script to call when the button is clicked/pressed. Optionally assign a parent
			object and the button will lock its x/y positions realtive to the parent object. This is useful for drawers or popups

			scr_add_sprite_button( X, Y, Sprite, Call Script, Layer, *Parent)
			Exactly the same as the other script, except you use a sprite instead of a generated button.

	###Drawers

		Drawers are used to add buttons and other elements in spaces outside of the screen that can be brought in when needed.
	
			Assigning a button to a drawer
	
				Simply set the "parent" argument of a button to the id of the drawer. The X/Y value will be the adjustment values 
				instead of being absolute x and values. 
		
			Assigning an object to a drawer
	
				Call the script "scr_child_to_parent" in the end step event of an object and specify the id of the drawer, which can be
				found using the scr_btn_find_drawer script.

	###Popups

		Popups are boxes that can display a specific payload of information. These are useful for an additional interactive layer
		past a drawer and promotional pieces. 
	
			scr_create_popup - Calls a popup, and is immediately displayed. Will not run if there is already a popup running. 
	
			scr_is_popup_open - Will return true if there is a popup running, false if not. 
	
			scr_cose_popup - Will close a popup, can be used to programmically close a popup under other circumstances beyond the "close"
			button.
