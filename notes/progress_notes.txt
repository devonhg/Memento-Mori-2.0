Left off working out how to integrate parenting into the buttons. Looks like the best way to do this
is to add a "lock to parent" argument to the button scripts, then x/y is relative to the parent.

I got a clear system going in the scripts for setting the x adjustment values, now I just need to 
program into the buttons what to do when told they have a parent.

I think I got the buttons "parenting" themselves well, now I just need to test them. 

To Test them, next time I sit down I'm going to do the following: 
- Build out a drawer, get the "Close Drawer" button working.

To accomplish this, in the create drawer script a button will be created childed
to the created drawer. This will then be the "up" or "down arrow" based on what kind of 
drawer it is

Currently implementing the day changing mechanic, as well as refining how data is handled.

Implemented the ability to check and run specific scripts if it's a new day, both immediate and delayed.
The delayed variants are good for notifications, while the immediate are good for setting things up.
( For instance, picking a new quote of the day )

Couple of facets on the database:
A function to pull all the quotes from the local database ( returns 2d array )
A function to pull all the quotes from the AT datbase ( returns 2d array ) -done
A function to merge two two dimensional arrays 
A function to take a two dimensional array and plop it into the local database, updating it.
A function to pick a quote of the day from the local database
A function to update the local database from a 2d array.
